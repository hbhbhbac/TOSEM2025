We previously tried something similar in https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/49578, but using `github.head_ref` didn't work.\n\nThe reason this PR works is because, for events besides `pull_request`, the value of `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` defaults to the empty string, so it's as if we didn't set the `ref` option for `actions/checkout` at all, so it just uses its default behavior (e.g. for `push` events).\n\nIncidentally, this PR also upgrades our use of `actions/checkout` from `v1` to `v2`, which introduces shallow clones by default. A couple of our jobs require deep clones, so we use `fetch-depth: 0` in those cases.\n\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/53719\n\nTest Plan: CI.\n\nReviewed By: albanD\n\nDifferential Revision: D26949121\n\nPulled By: samestep\n\nfbshipit-source-id: e06f8066682ae0557fb5a055a10ea33b6bd320db\n", "change_type": "updated", "type": ""}, {"name": "suo/add-annotations-github-action", "commit_message": "Update repo name for add-annotations-github-action (#53826)\n\nSummary:\nIt looks like https://github.com/suo/add-annotations-github-action redirects to https://github.com/pytorch/add-annotations-github-action, so this is a bit less confusing.\n\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/53826\n\nTest Plan: The clang-tidy CI job should pass on this PR.\n\nReviewed By: malfet\n\nDifferential Revision: D26981832\n\nPulled By: samestep\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 273c18535d0d27b14942b02ae552020ffc60623b\n", "change_type": "removed", "type": ""}, {"name": "actions/setup-python", "commit_message": "Upgrade actions/setup-python from v1 to v2 (#54202)\n\nSummary: Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/54202\n\nTest Plan: The lint and clang-format workflows in CI.\n\nReviewed By: janeyx99\n\nDifferential Revision: D27134223\n\nPulled By: samestep\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 7f38240696e31f1a479e93f6b326b9d13e3ddf9c\n", "change_type": "updated", "type": ""}, {"name": "actions/setup-python", "commit_message": "Add GitHub Actions workflow to test tools (#54207)\n\nSummary:\nThis PR closes https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/52866 by adding a GitHub Actions workflow to run the tests in the dir introduced by https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/53755.

Namespace Isolation for the PyTree Type Registry\n>\n> In addition to the JAX's pytree registry for custom node type registration, `optree` adds `namespace` isolation to the registry. Users can register the same type multiple times for different flatten/unflatten behavior. It also provides module-level isolation for safety reasons. For example, you can add a unique prefix to your namespace to isolate your registry with other modules (e.g., `torch.xxx`, `torch.functorch.xxx`):\n>\n> ```python\n> # Register a Python type into a namespace\n> import torch\n>\n> optree.register_pytree_node(\n>     torch.Tensor,\n>     # (tensor) -> (children, metadata)\n>     flatten_func=lambda tensor: (\n>         (tensor.cpu().numpy(),),\n>         dict(dtype=tensor.dtype, device=tensor.device, requires_grad=tensor.requires_grad),\n>     ),\n>     # (metadata, children) -> tensor\n>     unflatten_func=lambda metadata, children: torch.tensor(children[0], **metadata),\n>     namespace='torch.torch2numpy',\n> )\n> ```\n>\n> ```python\n> >>> tree = {'weight': torch.ones(size=(1, 2)).cuda(), 'bias': torch.zeros(size=(2,))}\n> >>> tree\n> {'weight': tensor([[1., 1.]], device='cuda:0'), 'bias': tensor([0., 0.])}\n>\n> # Flatten without specifying the namespace\n> >>> tree_flatten(tree)  # `torch.Tensor`s are leaf nodes\n> ([tensor([0., 0.]), tensor([[1., 1.]], device='cuda:0')], PyTreeSpec({'bias': *, 'weight': *}))\n>\n> # Flatten with the namespace\n> >>> leaves, treespec = optree.tree_flatten(tree, namespace='torch.torch2numpy')\n> >>> leaves, treespec\n> (\n>     [array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), array([[1., 1.]], dtype=float32)],\n>     PyTreeSpec(\n>         {\n>             'bias': CustomTreeNode(Tensor[{'dtype': torch.float32, 'device': device(type='cpu'), 'requires_grad': False}], [*]),\n>             'weight': CustomTreeNode(Tensor[{'dtype': torch.float32, 'device': device(type='cuda', index=0), 'requires_grad': False}], [*])\n>         },\n>         namespace='torch.torch2numpy'\n>     )\n> )\n>\n> # `entries` are not defined and use `range(len(children))`\n> >>> optree.tree_paths(tree, namespace='torch.torch2numpy')\n> [('bias', 0), ('weight', 0)]\n>\n> # Unflatten back to a copy of the original object\n> >>> optree.tree_unflatten(treespec, leaves)\n> {'bias': tensor([0., 0.]), 'weight': tensor([[1., 1.]], device='cuda:0')}\n> ```\n>\n> Check out section [Registering a Container-like Custom Type as Non-leaf Nodes](https://github.com/metaopt/optree#notes-about-the-pytree-type-registry) for more details.\n>\n> ### 3. Support both `None` as Non-leaf Node and `None` as Leaf\n>\n> In JAX's implementation, `None` is always an internal non-leaf node with an arity 0, which is like an empty tuple. This limits the usage of the JAX's pytree utilities for PyTorch. For example, the `nn.Module` uses `_parameters` and `_buffers` (`OrderedDict[str, Optional[Tensor]]`) to hold the tensors, while the value can be a tensor or `None`.\n>\n> `optree` supports both `None` as Non-leaf Node (JAX's default) and `None` as Leaf (PyTorch's default). Check out section [None is Non-leaf Node vs. None is Leaf](https://github.com/metaopt/optree#none-is-non-leaf-node-vs-none-is-leaf) for more details.\n>\n> ### 4. Some other improvements and bug fixes\n>\n> 1. Adds in-place version of treemap (`tree_map_`), which reduces redundant unflatten operation for better performance.\n> 2. Adds support for tree flatten and tree map with paths. (useful for `functorch` module extraction).\n> 3. Improves the JAX's pytree sorting support for `dict`s.\n> 4. Better string representation `repr(PyTreeSpec)`.\n> 5. Fixes some bugs for JAX's pytree of hashing, pickle serialization, segmentation fault for infinite recursion, and tree-compose/tree-transpose.\n\nFrom https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/92679#issuecomment-1398778481:\n\n> ```python\n> # pytree_make_fx_bench.py\n> import torch\n> from torch.fx.experimental.proxy_tensor import make_fx\n> import time\n>\n> def f(x):\n>     for _ in range(10000):\n>         x = x+x\n>     return x\n>\n> import time\n> begin = time.time()\n> out = make_fx(f, tracing_mode=\"real\")(torch.randn(20))\n> begin = time.time()\n> print(f'tracing_mode=\"real\" {time.time() -
